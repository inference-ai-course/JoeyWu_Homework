We demonstrate how retrieval of noun phrases and pronominal forms, along with a zero-sum weighting scheme, determines topicalized segmentation. Futhermore, we use term distribution to aid in identifying the role that the segment performs in the document. Finally, we present results of evaluation in terms of precision and recall which surpass earlier approaches.\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Computation and Language\n[Submitted on 17 Sep 1998]\nTitle:Modelling Users, Intentions, and Structure in Spoken Dialog\nView PDFAbstract: We outline how utterances in dialogs can be interpreted using a partial first order logic. We exploit the capability of this logic to talk about the truth status of formulae to define a notion of coherence between utterances and explain how this coherence relation can serve for the construction of AND/OR trees that represent the segmentation of the dialog. In a BDI model we formalize basic assumptions about dialog and cooperative behaviour of participants. These assumptions provide a basis for inferring speech acts from coherence relations between utterances and attitudes of dialog participants. Speech acts prove to be useful for determining dialog segments defined on the notion of completing expectations of dialog participants. Finally, we sketch how explicit segmentation signalled by cue phrases and performatives is covered by our dialog model.\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

This report and the grammar described herein supersedes the TAG grammar described in an earlier 1995 XTAG technical report. The English grammar described in this report is based on the TAG formalism which has been extended to include lexicalization, and unification-based feature structures. The range of syntactic phenomena that can be handled is large and includes auxiliaries (including inversion), copula, raising and small clause constructions, topicalization, relative clauses, infinitives, gerunds, passives, adjuncts, it-clefts, wh-clefts, PRO constructions, noun-noun modifications, extraposition, determiner sequences, genitives, negation, noun-verb contractions, sentential adjuncts and imperatives. This technical report corresponds to the XTAG Release 8/31/98. The XTAG grammar is continuously updated with the addition of new analyses and modification of old ones, and an online version of this report can be found at the XTAG web page at this http URL\nSubmission history\nFrom: Anoop Sarkar [view email][v1] Fri, 18 Sep 1998 00:33:47 UTC (530 KB)\n[v2] Fri, 18 Sep 1998 02:49:22 UTC (531 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Prefix Probabilities from Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars",
    "abstract": "Computer Science > Computation and Language\n[Submitted on 18 Sep 1998]\nTitle:Prefix Probabilities from Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars\nView PDFAbstract: Language models for speech recognition typically use a probability model of the form Pr(a_n | a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}). Stochastic grammars, on the other hand, are typically used to assign structure to utterances. A language model of the above form is constructed from such grammars by computing the prefix probability Sum_{w in Sigma*} Pr(a_1 ... a_n w), where w represents all possible terminations of the prefix a_1 ... a_n. The main result in this paper is an algorithm to compute such prefix probabilities given a stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG). The algorithm achieves the required computation in O(n^6) time. The probability of subderivations that do not derive any words in the prefix, but contribute structurally to its derivation, are precomputed to achieve termination. This algorithm enables existing corpus-based estimation techniques for stochastic TAGs to be used for language modelling.\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Conditions on Consistency of Probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammars",
    "abstract": "Computer Science > Computation and Language\n[Submitted on 18 Sep 1998]\nTitle:Conditions on Consistency of Probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammars\nView PDFAbstract: Much of the power of probabilistic methods in modelling language comes from their ability to compare several derivations for the same string in the language. An important starting point for the study of such cross-derivational properties is the notion of _consistency_. The probability model defined by a probabilistic grammar is said to be _consistent_ if the probabilities assigned to all the strings in the language sum to one. From the literature on probabilistic context-free grammars (CFGs), we know precisely the conditions which ensure that consistency is true for a given CFG. This paper derives the conditions under which a given probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) can be shown to be consistent. It gives a simple algorithm for checking consistency and gives the formal justification for its correctness. The conditions derived here can be used to ensure that probability models that use TAGs can be checked for _deficiency_ (i.e. whether any probability mass is assigned to strings that cannot be generated).\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
